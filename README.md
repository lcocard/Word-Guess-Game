- In this game, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic.

- Using key events to listen for the letters that the players type.

- The following will display on the page:

   - If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   - As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _ _ a`.

3. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

4. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).
